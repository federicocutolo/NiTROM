"""Array-backend abstraction for NiTROM.

NiTROM's math (operator inference, NiTROM adjoint, projections, time steppers)
is written against a small :class:`Backend` shim rather than ``torch`` directly,
so the same code runs on either **NumPy** (lightweight, ideal for small CPU
problems) or **PyTorch** (autograd, GPU).  The active backend is process-global
and chosen with :func:`set_backend`::

    from nitrom.backend import set_backend
    set_backend("numpy")   # or "torch"

Objects bind to whatever backend is active *when they are constructed*, so a
model built under NumPy stays NumPy even if the global backend later changes.

``torch`` is imported lazily (only when the torch backend or the distributed
helpers are used), so importing this module does not pull torch into a
NumPy-only session.

        for its parameter VJP -- and at ``r = 50`` the naive loop costs an order
